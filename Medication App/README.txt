This is a simple desktop application that allows the user to 
enter the name, dose (in number of pills), total number of pills, and 
scheduled times for multiple medications.

At the desired time(s) of day, an alert launches reminding the user to
take their medication. These alerts will reoccur until the user has run
out of pills.

The app is launched by running the "SimpleGUI" class. The user can store 
medications they are taking by filling out the required
fields and pressing the "Save Medication" button. If the user must take
a medication multiple times a day, press the "More Times" button to allow
for multiple time inputs. To remove the addional times press the "Remove
Times" button.

Once medications have been added, a "Current Medications" tab will appear.
Click the tab to see medications that the user has previously entered. 
Press "Remove XXX" button, where XXX is the name of the medication, to
remove the desired medication from the system.
